DevOps is a combination of software development (dev) and operations (ops).

It is defined as a software engineering methodology which aims to integrate the 
work of development teams and operations teams by faciliating a culture of 
collaboration and shared responsibility.

Automation : Automation in DevOps boosts speed, consistency, higher accuracy, reliability, and increases the number
             of deliveries.
Scaling :  A scalable DevOps means the system can expand automatically during a high workload and shrink back 
           when the needs are reduced to normal. 

DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development 
of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
